# Civil Infrastructure Platform (CIP) Landscape

![Landscape Logo](https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/07/civil-infrastructure-platform_cip_logo_color-horizontal.svg)

This landscape is intended as a map to explore the member companies of the Civil Infrastructure Platform (CIP). It is modeled after the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) [landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io) and based on the same open-source code.

This repository contains the data files and images required to generate the [CNCF landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io). The software that generates it can be found at the [cncf/landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) repository. Please see its [README file](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2#landscape2) for more information about how it works.
